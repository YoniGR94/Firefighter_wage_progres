# Firefighter Wage Progres

__Effect of wildfires on firefighters wage in the US__

This was created for 2 main reasons
1. Presenting work with API
2. Discuss wildfire situation in the US as a study case

### Intro

:dart: Goal: present different approaches to see whether there is effect of number of acres that burned in the US to the firefighters' average wage by state.

:question: Why: If so, global warming and natural disasters may increase  the firefighters salary, al least enough to keep the same amount of them in the sistem.

:scroll: How: I used mainly linear models and visualization in order to present the results, and then discussed them. 

The data came from API and xlsx downloaded files from [Data USA](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/firefighters) and the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org). In addition, [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) provide us the key to the states names.

Here is a relation summary of the data that have been used:

### Data anlyzing

We say that in general, there is wage growth over the years of firefighters. I wanted to see whether this effect is more year correlated or more wildfire correlated

Here is the year by year progress:

And Here is the by year progress as linear graph:

### Conclution

We evaluated that there is no effect of the wildfires cases on firefighters wage. We say this is not necessarily bad.
an additional analysis will need to use more data or more importent, to isolate importent variables.

More can bee found in the html presentation of the project.
