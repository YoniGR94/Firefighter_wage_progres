# Firefighter Wage Progres

### Effect of wildfires on firefighters wage in the US

The goal of this project is  to present different approaches to see whether there is effect of number of acres that burned in the US to the firefighters' average wage by state. If so, global warming and natural disasters may increase  the firefighters salary, al least enough to keep the same amount of them in the sistem.

I used mainly linear models and visualization in order to present the results, and then discussed them. 

The data came from API and xlsx downloaded files from [Data USA](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/firefighters) and the [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org). In addition, [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) provide us the key to the states names.

This was created for 2 main reasons
1. Presenging work with API
2. Discuss wildfire situation in the US as a study case
